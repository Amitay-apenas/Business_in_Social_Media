                    Social media has transformed product promotion. Organizations can now directly engage with
                    consumers, build relationships, and understand their preferences. However, this also presents
                    challenges like maintaining pace with platform changes and managing potential online crises.

                        customers, and run promotions. However, it's important to have a consistent strategy and post
                        high-quality content.

                        A website is essential for any business, as it serves as a digital storefront. It allows
                        customers to learn about your products or services, contact you, and make purchases. A
                        well-designed website can help you establish credibility and attract new customers.
