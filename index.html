                    Social media has transformed product promotion. Organizations can now directly engage with
                    consumers, build relationships, and understand their preferences. However, this also presents
                    challenges like maintaining pace with platform changes and managing potential online crises.

                            The Facebook audience is very broad. It attracts people of all ages, cultures and interests.
                            Whether you want to share photos, follow news or make new friends, Facebook is a space for
                            everyone.

                            Instagram is the platform's focus on visual
                            content, like photos and videos, and its association with trends and influencers make it
                            particularly popular among people aged 18-34.

                            Young people, mainly teenagers and young adults. They love short videos, music and trends.
                            TikTok is like a digital playground for this generation, where they express themselves, have
                            fun and connect with other young people.
